text: I try to keep this page updated about my current interests within the peer-to-peer web space.

In the past I've built a few applications that express some of the possibilities of the peer-to-peer web. Although, it was an amazing experience and I'm proud of what I've made, I also see this (focusing so much on making) as a mistake. That's why my current interests have changed from *more building* to *more thinking*.

### Currently

I'm not working on any projects related to the peer-to-peer web.
