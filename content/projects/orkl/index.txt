description: Super simple peer-to-peer blogging site
----
text: I wanted to build a peer-to-peer only blog; kind of like the p2p child of Svbtle and Telegra.ph. Fell in love with the idea of a site, which feels the same for the writer and the reader. The only difference is that the writer can change the content and the reader can't. Thanks to [Dat](https://datproject.org/), we can easily decide if a computer is the owner or not of a site.

orkl is also 100% dynamic, so it's basically just a bunch of ```txt``` files (using [smarkt](https://github.com/jondashkyle/smarkt)) = no site generation or building.

### Usage
The magic of Beaker Browser is the possibility to fork a site. To get started you can fork any orkl site, but for the sake of simplicity we will use an empty site I've made.

- Download [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com)
- Navigate to [dat://orkl-kodedninja.hashbase.io](dat://orkl-kodedninja.hashbase.io)
- Find the "Fork this site" button, click it and fill out with your information
- Navigate to your site
- Edit the site's dat.json, adding `"fallback_page": "index.html"`
- Read the "How to use orkl?" entry
