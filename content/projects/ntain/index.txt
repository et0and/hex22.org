description: A peer-to-peer file sharing application based on Beaker
----
text: Ntain was my first try in making a peer-to-peer application based on Beaker Browser. I love it's design, but it misses many functionalities.

You can use it by forking ```dat://ntain-kodedninja.hashbase.io``` in [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com).
