text: I love [choo](https://github.com/choojs/coo), but sometimes it's too much. For example when I want to use a simple component in a static site. I was too lazy to find a module for that so I've built one.

Uses [nanomorph](https://github.com/choojs/nanomorph) under the hood.

### installation

`npm i -S bik`

### documentation
On Github.
