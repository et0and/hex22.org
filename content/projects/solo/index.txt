description: The simplest publishing tool

text: #### [Github](https://github.com/kodedninja/solo) [Website]()

Solo is a publishing tool based on the [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) and the Dat protocol.

The main inspiration was [Telegra.ph](http://telegra.ph). Every entry is under a different Dat URL and there's no index page like on blogs or publishing platforms.

Only *disconnected texts* that centralize in the author's mind.

Solo is a simplified version of [orkl](/projects/orkl).
