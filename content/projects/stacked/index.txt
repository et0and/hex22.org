text: If you hate using a service that depends on your connectivity for project management ("todo-listing") and you think sticky-notes aren't eco-friendly + too physical, you're like me and you'll like Stacked.

Stacked is a project management tool based on [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) and [DAT](https://datproject.org), meaning that you own all your data and you don't depend on the cloud (which in many cases isn't available).
