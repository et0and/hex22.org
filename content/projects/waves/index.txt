text: Its major goal is not to be fast, but to be more beautiful.

Inspired by Devine's [Shorthand](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/#Shorthand) and by existing shorthand systems, I developed my own. I'm a very fast writer, but I do write very ugly. With waves I want to change this: a bit slower, but more beautiful writing.

Waves written down looks like the waves of the sea (after a magical transformation).
