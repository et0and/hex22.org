I was struggling with copy + pasting the ```bundle.js``` of my projects, when I made a few updates so I wrote this little module that updates local files to the upstream files if you (the site owner) want to.

It's included in [orkl](/projects/orkl) and in [solo](/projects/solo) too. You can update them by going to ```dat://[url]/update```.
