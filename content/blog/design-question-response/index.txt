excerpt: When I was a child my guitar teacher taught me a simple way to think about music composition.
----
text: He said that a piece is like a **conversation** between two egos in the music. One of them asks a question and the other one responds. For the composer this compiles to: **Asking a question with a melody and responding to that with another one**.

In reality this isn't that simple because a melody can be a question somewhere in the piece and a response somewhere else ― or the response can be the question itself. *Like a person's role in a conversation changes from emitter to receiver and vice-versa.* Basically these variations make music unpredictable.

The point is that this very simple structure makes a flow in the listening and in the writing process. The listener never receives a response without a question (the part where a theme is introduced) and the whole piece won't feel chaotic and disoriented. 

I think about this system in interface design too.

What you want in design is a predictable **conversation**. A learnable **conversation**, where you learn the personality of the interface and know the answers before questioning.

On a good interface you don't have to find a question to respond to or the question to your possible response (for example searching for the login field or button). A good interface asks the right questions at the right time and these can be answered without much thinking. *In our society clicking, scrolling, tapping work subcounciously, anyways.*

A designer's job is to know what questions might be in the user's head at a given time and give him the biggest possible "*question mark*" on that part of the interface. Asking the right questions about a problem is what design's about. A question can be the content, a button, a link or the urge to scroll, etc...

So, before including something into an interface and before thinking hours on its location, I try to find the question that element should respond to. 

The question and the context give the properties (position, size, content) of the element . 

The result is a natural **conversation** between interface and user. **An information flow between computer and human.**
