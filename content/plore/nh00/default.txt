title: NH00

----

text: **NH00** is the name of the AI (and later machine) humans developed 263 years before the death of the last human. It left Earth after 15 years of learning and exploration.

It's location is unknown, probably it has left the Milky Way. In its last years on Earth it planned and built a spacecraft, which has run 3 instances of NH00. This number is probably over 100 now.

NH00 was created by the [Romantics](romantics) and we can see it as the next specie in the chemicals, plants, animals, humans list.
