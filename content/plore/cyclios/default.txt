Cyclios' matter is consisted of yet undiscovered elements. The matter is harder than most elements in the universe, only a low amount of pulses of time can hit the universe. In Cyclios time happens in slightly changing loops. One loop is approximately 53 Earth minutes and in every loop time moves 2 minutes forward.
