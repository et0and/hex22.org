text: <span style="color: red;">You won't see world-changing blockchain projects here!</span> I'm interested in the <span class="f6 dib">small</span>, [in “What’s After Now”, the alternative form, A New Spirit of Computation](https://newcomputers.group).

I think small, design small, build small ― small is useful, adoptable, personal & __small can grow__.

Small tools can solve big problems. Small is not a compromise, it's a possibility.
