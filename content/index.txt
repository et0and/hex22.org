text: I want you to spend a few instants thinking about how did you access this site.

If you used the domain name **hex22.org**, first a request to a DNS resolver was sent, that returned the IP address of a Github Pages server (on **https://**) or a Dat URL (seen below).

With the IP address, a connection with that server is made, which returns the [**index.html**](https://github.com/kodedninja/kodedninja.github.io/blob/master/index.html).

Using a Dat key, the Dat module under the hood of [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) connects to the closest peer seeding the site. The same **index.html** is returned. If there are no available peers, my personal Hashbase instance (running in a [DO](https://digitalocean.com) droplet) will act as a seeder. If you're already seeding the site, it's loaded from your machine.

The HTML file is rendered in your browser and a few other requests travel back-and-forth to the same location to get font files, the main Javascript file and the content (via [Enoki](https://enoki.site)).

The site is built using [choo](https://choo.io) with [Enoki](https://enoki.site).
