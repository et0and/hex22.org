text: Postella is a micro, low-tech composting system designed to be easy to maintain and assemble. Made using recycled pallets and coffee bags, it is also a very low cost solution (the only true cost of Edamame is with the nails and screws needed to assemble it, and a cost of time putting each module together). 

The project schematics are completely free to use, modify and distribute under the terms of CC-BY-SA 4.0.
