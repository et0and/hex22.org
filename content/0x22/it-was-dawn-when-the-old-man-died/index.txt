At dawn warmer waves arrive to the surface of Earth. They break up into millions of other waves, then return into the atmosphere. These waves are the reason that life exists on Earth. These waves our the reason why we die.

"It was dawn when the old man died I." presents 3 perspectives of a dawn. Is just a simple dawn the same for a dying man, for a couple or for a child? Is it the same for you and me?

"It was dawn when the old man died II." is an experimental slowed down version of the first track. Doesn't sure which one describes more the concept.
