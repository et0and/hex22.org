I work on experimental [tools and projects](/projects) that form a greater system: *life*. My main focus is designing and making functional tools / interfaces. I'm a true fan of peer-to-peer networking, functional design and the *[computer](https://newcomputers.group)*. 

Currently I'm making and researching tools for the [peer-to-peer web](/p2p).

Sometimes I [write](/writing) about the things I see or think.

 [0x22](/0x22) is my music project.

 You can visit the [Log](/log) for a consistently updating tracker of my productivity or read my [devlog](https://devlog-kodedninja.hashbase.io), where I write an entry every week to sum up my productive outcome.
