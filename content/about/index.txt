I work on experimental [tools and projects](/projects) that form a greater system: *life*. My main focus is on designing and making functional tools / interfaces. I enjoy [researching](https://are.na/hunor-karaman/index) about possible and impossible futures.

My goal is to optimize life and my way of living (whatever does this "optimize" mean). *I do not like illogical.*

I'm a true fan of peer-to-peer networking, functional design and the *computer*. And **not** a fan of ~~money~~, ~~web trackers~~ and ~~capitalism~~.

Sometimes I [write](/writing) about the things I see or think.

 [0x22](/0x22) is my music project.

 You can visit the [Log](/log) for a consistently updating tracker of my productivity.
