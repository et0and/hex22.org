## Projects
***
Most of my work has involved working within the arts and/or education sector. Web applications and resources have been mostly in vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript, but with a heavy reliance on APIs from [are.na](https://are.na), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com), [Backblaze B2](https://backblaze.com) et al.

- [Artists from Asia](https://artistsfrom.asia), a database of Asian artists made using the are.na API
- [Some Quiet Tips](https://some.quiet.tips), a mental health resource app
- [Whitecubes](https://map.pmop.xyz), an interactive map of art spaces in New Zealand

I also work(ed) in the following groups:
