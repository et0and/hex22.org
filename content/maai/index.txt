text: Maai is an experimental management strategy focusing on how my time and resources are divided. The project is inspired by Sergey Brin's philosophy of splitting things 70/20/10, with 70 percent dedicated to core priorities and obligations, 20 percent to adjacent projects that help to extend/grow/tend to core commitments, and 10 percent being totally free and experimental (now, next, later).

The strategy can also be applied to investments. Currently, 70 percent of my earnings is dedicated towards living expenses and core costs. 20 percent is dedicated to short-term savings (funds that remain completely liquid should they need to be used for an emergency or unexpected expense), and the remaining 10 percent is put towards growth investments that I am prepared to lose should they fail.
