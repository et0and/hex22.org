text: Maai is an experimental management philosophy focusing on how my time and resources are divided. The project is inspired by Sergey Brin's philosophy of splitting things 70%/20%/10%, with 70% dedicated to core priorities and obligations, 20% to adjacent projects that help to extend/grow/tend to core commitments, and 10% being totally free and experimental.
