text: I try to keep this page updated about my <u>current</u> interests within the peer-to-peer web space.

In the past I've built a few applications that express some of the possibilities of the peer-to-peer web. Although, it was an amazing experience and I'm proud of what I've made, I also see this (focusing so much on making) as a mistake. That's why my current interests have changed from *more building* to *more thinking*.

### I am

- Thinking about what does it mean to be members of these new, peer-to-peer spaces
- Working on a little site seeder that includes server-side rendering for the `http://` version
- Still integrating the peer-to-peer web into my life to see what's possible and what should be changed
