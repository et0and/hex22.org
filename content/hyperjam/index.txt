text: Hyperjam is an online interactive art event hosted by [Merveilles](https://tom.so/merveilles). Within a virtualised HyperCard environment, all participants are to create works over the first weekend of April and share it with the fediverse.

This will be the first event by Merveilles that I participate in, and am greatly looking forward to it!
