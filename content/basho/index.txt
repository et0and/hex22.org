text: Basho is a digital journal powered by and built on top of [Urbit](https://urbit.org), a clean-slate OS and network.

Posts are made daily and central to my personal research/planning. Occasionally, I publish posts to be distributed via [Ames](https://urbit.org/docs/tutorials/arvo/ames/), set on my Urbit ID ~falsef-nostyp.
