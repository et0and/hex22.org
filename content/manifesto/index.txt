text: 1. **Everything should be a tool.** A tool transforms your data without adding to its original limitations. It returns an output for a given input. A platform can also be a tool, but only under the same restrictions and if it offers a platform specific functionality. 
2. **Data should be reusable, text-editable, human-readable.**
3. **Tools should be lightweight, available and timeless.** Computing power or internet speed shouldn't be the limitation for most tasks. It works in the past and in the future.
4. **Tools should be adaptable, changeable and personalisable**. If a tool does not perfectly fit your needs, you should be able to change, mix or remove its parts.
5. **A great tool is [ambient](https://are.na/alex-singh/ambient-product-design).** It should disappear and flow through your actions. You should never need it because it's always at your hands. You should never ignore it because it's never in your way.
