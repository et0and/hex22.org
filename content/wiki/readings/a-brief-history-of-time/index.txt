text: There isn't much to add to this classic, but I want to leave a praising note here. It's a great book and, in my point of view, its place on the bookshelf of history is rock-solid.

Hawking wasn't just a grandiose mind, he was also able to wrap his thoughts into a simple and many times funny language, without losing the scientific validity of the presented topics somewhere on the way to readibility.

I definitely recommend it to anyone, who's interested in the universe, in life and in nature.
