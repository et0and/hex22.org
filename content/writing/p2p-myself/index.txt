excerpt: Since I've started digging into the peer-to-peer internet I wanted to move my site onto it. Today I found the way that perfectly fits into my workflow.

I've moved the site off of Github Pages and onto a combo of [now.sh](https://now.sh) and [Hashbase](https://hashbase.io). Finally I'm able to use magical subdomains of hex22.org on Dat.

### The core of the site: Enoki
[Enoki](https://enoki.site) is an "An experimental ~~platform~~ tool for peer-to-peer publishing" â€• simply a CMS on the [Dat](https://dat-project.org) protocol.

The site was based on the pre-alpha version of it (a static-site generator with a CMS page) and I wasn't able to move it to the Beta version, because that's a "peer-to-peer first" tool. Today this changed too, because I rewrote it to use the Panel and I'm amazed by the feeling of it. It's the best writing / CMS tool I've ever used. Everything feels so natural and *in the flow*. Thumbs up, [Jon Kyle](https://jon-kyle.com).

### Hashbase
Hashbase is a seeding service by the developers of the [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com). Although peer-to-peer sites are powered by their users, it's good to have a constant peer. I try to use Hashbase as little as possible, because using for everything would break the peer-to-peer side of the sites. Also, I seed every Dat site I've visited and liked.

Currently I have a free account on Hashbase, but I'm on the edge of the 100 MB free limit. I'm planning to upgrade and have 15 GB of space. That's a lot!

### HTTP version
Command line tools have a warm place in my heart. That's why I've started using [now](https://now.sh) and used it for a few projects. More complex tasks are done in a few keystrokes (ie: buying domain names, DNS settings, SSL certs.).

The ```hex22.org``` domain was bought with *now* too. One thing I didn't know is that custom domains aren't supported in the OSS (free) plan. That's why until now the site was on Github Pages, but for the Dat URL I needed an ```https``` certificate.

Custom domains on Dat work like this: Beaker checks for a ```https://your-domain.com/.well-known/dat``` file and gets the raw dat URL from that.

Since my SSL certificate was valid only on ```now.sh``` servers I've decided to move the HTTP version to *now* and change my plan from OSS to On-Demand, which means I pay only for what I use. For a small project like this it's a very good price.

---

This means that currently I pay less than 2$ per month for this site, but when I upgrade my Hashbase plan there will be a **+7$/n** per month, where **n** is the number of projects hosted on Hashbase.

In the future I can do the same for subdomains for a +1.5$/domain.
