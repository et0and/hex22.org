text: Gaia is a mass recycling and upcycling app aimed at reducing landfill waste. 

Leveraging existing commercial services by [Terracycle](), [Upcycle]() and [Abilities](), Gaia acts as a middleman for those wanting to responsibly dispose of the following items:

- Dolce Gusto Nespresso Capsules
- Plastic toothbrushes
- Toothpaste packaging
- Compostable coffee cups and lids
- Coffee bags (Supreme, Kokako, Peoples)
- LCD televisions 
- Plasma televisions
- CRT box televisions 
- Laptops
- Desktop computers
- Printers and ink cartridges
- Cellphones
- GLAD ziplock bags 
- GLAD wrap (or equivalent)
- Batteries (AA, AAA, car)

This is a community project. Please be aware that I am the sole person working on Gaia, and that (particularly for e-waste items) it is entirely funded by me. While it is still in its infancy, Gaia might take a little while to respond to you. 

The app and project is still in active development, with plans to create a carbon neutral (or negative) means of collecting waste from households. Any suggestions and feedback would be highly appreciated. 

For more information or queries please contact [mail@gaia.sh](mailto:mail@gaia.sh) or message me on [Telegram](https://t.me/hackshaw)
