text: <u>An ambient music project</u>

[Bandcamp](https://0x22.bandcamp.com)

Since 2015, after bands and instrumental music projects, [I](/karaman-hunor)'ve started composing electronical music. It started with making noises for a progressive metal album, but later I've found long sine waves and fell in love with the ambient / drone sounding.

I'm inspired by feelings and the music of talented musicians like Nils Frahm, Celer or Ã“lafur Arnalds.
