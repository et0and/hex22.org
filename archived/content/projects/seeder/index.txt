text: There are 2 problems with the availability of sites on the **dat://** protocol: 1.) if you turn off your computer and nobody's seeding it, it'll be unaccessible 2.) if everyone solves this with a seeding service ([Hashbase](https://hashbase.io)) the whole network will start to become more centralized.

An alternative is setting up a seeding service for yourself. A [Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.org) runs super power-efficiently and it's powerful enough to seed DAT archives. 

**Seeder** tries to be a plug-and-play, ready-to-use DAT seeder service. With a 1-command installer and frontend designed for non-tech people it's the simplest personal seeding service.

Developed as part of the [New Computer Working Group](https://newcomputers.group).
