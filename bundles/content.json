    "excerpt": "When I was a child my guitar teacher taught me a simple way to think about music composition.",
    "text": "He said that a piece is like a **conversation** between two egos in the music. One of them asks a question and the other one responds. For the composer this compiles to: **Asking a question with a melody and responding to that with another one**.\n\nIn reality this isn't that simple because a melody can be a question somewhere in the piece and a response somewhere else ― or the response can be the question itself. *Like a person's role in a conversation changes from emitter to receiver and vice-versa.* Basically these variations make music unpredictable.\n\nThe point is that this very simple structure makes a flow in the listening and in the writing process. The listener never receives a response without a question (the part where a theme is introduced) and the whole piece won't feel chaotic and disoriented. \n\nI think about this system in interface design too.\n\nWhat you want in design is a predictable **conversation**. A learnable **conversation**, where you learn the personality of the interface and know the answers before questioning.\n\nOn a good interface you don't have to find a question to respond to or the question to your possible response (for example searching for the login field or button). A good interface asks the right questions at the right time and these can be answered without much thinking. *In our society clicking, scrolling, tapping work subcounciously, anyways.*\n\nA designer's job is to know what questions might be in the user's head at a given time and give him the biggest possible \"*question mark*\" on that part of the interface. Asking the right questions about a problem is what design's about. A question can be the content, a button, a link or the urge to scroll, etc...\n\nSo, before including something into an interface and before thinking hours on its location, I try to find the question that element should respond to. \n\nThe question and the context give the properties (position, size, content) of the element . \n\nThe result is a natural **conversation** between interface and user. **An information flow between computer and human.**\n\n[WIP]",

    "excerpt": "Just a note about systems / tools I want to mention in later entries.",
    "text": "Most of them are newcomers to my life, but they changed my workflow and day-to-day life significantly. Probably I forgot a few, but will edit this entry later.\n\nIt's also an all-around description of these tools and the reason I use them.\n\n---\n\n[Log](https://joshavanier.itch.io/log) was the first tool I've started using late last year. Inspired by [Devine](https://wiki.xxiivv.com) I wanted to write my own time-tracker, but then I've found Josh's and it was a perfect fit. I don't use it for prediction (yet), but mostly to review my productive output.\n\n![Log screenshot](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTg3ODI5LzEwMDM4ODQucG5n/original/Yvd0oU.png)\n\n[Are.na](https://are.na). Oh, Are.na. It's one of the best tools I've found in my whole life. I'm not sure why, but I love it so much it's not describable. A perfect example of functional design. I'm very new there, but [I use it a lot](https://are.na/hunor-karaman/index). \"Social media that helps you think\"? Yes, please. My one-word description of Are.na is *quality*. Quality people, quality content, quality website.\n\n![Are.na screenshot](/content/writing/later-here/arena-screenshot.png)\n\n[Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) is a bit different than the others, but I must write about it because it changed the way I think about the internet. I feel 100% better browsing on the peer-to-peer web, enjoying the beauty of 64 characters long urls, seeding and forking sites. Making personal tools based on it like [orkl](/projects/orkl) or [ntain](/projects/ntain). Or using what other people made like Dropout.\n\n[Dropout](https://dropout.jon-kyle.com) is a tool that *\"saves a url as static html/json for later offline access and personal archive\"*. It was made by Jon Kyle, whose work inspire me a lot. Three tools from this list were made by him. He's a good guy. I mostly use Dropout to save documentations for offline access, as I try to reduce my internet usage.\n\n![Dropout screenshot](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/33131061d30a2b6e36109cf7efc3797d84ffe3f0/687474703a2f2f64726f702e6a6f6e2d6b796c652e636f6d2f6d6f64756c65732f64726f706f75742d6265616b65722d322e706e67)\n\nAnother one from Jon. [Enoki](https://enoki.site) is *\"an experimental ~~platform~~ tool for peer-to-peer publishing\"*. It's basically a static-site generator with a simple CMS. Exactly what I was looking for. This site uses the \"original\" version ([enoki-starterkit](https://github.com/enokidotsite/starterkit)), but Jon's currently working on a new Enoki.\n\n*Update: The site now uses the [Enoki Panel](https://panel.enoki.site).*\n\n[Hardly Everything](https://hardlyeverything.com) is the last tool in the list that's by Jon. It supplies you with an \"anti-feed\". You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/jondashkyle/hardly-everything). The way I use it is that I save different sites and a set a \"pace\" for them. There are pages that I usually check too often, even if they have new content only once a while, so I put them into Hardly Everything and access them only from there. This isn't a rule, but I try to act like it would be. I'm much more organized, because in the morning I go through my feed and then I don't check them again for a day.\\\n(*Note: I've realized that I used the term \"put them into\" and it sounds a bit weird, but I do think about Hardly Everything as a grinder machine that destroys the low-quality time spent on these websites \"unintentionally\".*)\n\n![Hardly Everything screeshot](/content/writing/later-here/hardly-everything.png)\n\nI also want to write about how I use my phone. It has changed much in the past month. It's more ambient and less distracting.\n\n> \"Yeah, I think phones have failed us.\" - Edouerd Urcades\n\n---\nUpdate: I've came across Alex Singh's blog and found [this entry](https://alexsingh.svbtle.com/ambient-interventions-for-2018). He pretty much talks about the same tools as me, with better writing skills. I follow [Alex's channel](https://www.are.na/alex-singh/ambient-product-design) on Are.na and it makes me happy that he too is amazed by these tools.",

To get started you can fork any orkl site, but for the sake of simplicity we will use an empty site I've made.\n\n- Download [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com)\n- Navigate to [dat://orkl-kodedninja.hashbase.io](dat://orkl-kodedninja.hashbase.io)\n- Find the \"Fork this site\" button, click it and fill out with your information\n- Navigate to your site\n- Edit the site's dat.json, adding `\"fallback_page\": \"index.html\"`\n- Read the \"How to use orkl?\" entry",

Every entry is under a different Dat URL and there's no index page like on blogs or publishing platforms.\n\nOnly *disconnected texts* that centralize in the author's mind.\n\nSolo is a simplified version of [orkl](/projects/orkl).",

    "priority": "9",
    "text": "There are 2 problems with the availability of sites on the **dat://** protocol: 1.) if you turn off your computer and nobody's seeding it, it'll be unaccessible 2.) if everyone solves this with a seeding service ([Hashbase](https://hashbase.io)) the whole network will start to become more centralized.\n\nAn alternative is setting up a seeding service for yourself. A [Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.org) runs super power-efficiently and it's powerful enough to seed DAT archives. \n\n**Seeder** tries to be a plug-and-play, ready-to-use DAT seeder service. With a 1-command installer and frontend designed for non-tech people it's the simplest personal seeding service.\n\nDeveloped as part of the [New Computer Working Group](https://newcomputers.group).",
